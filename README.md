## **Scouting Analysis - Data Analytics Workshop 1**  

### **Project Overview**  
This project is part of a data analytics workshop focused on player scouting for **Sunderland AFC**, an English second-division football club. The dataset used in this analysis comes from **FIFA 23**, containing real-world data of **22,080 players**, collected in **February 2023** by a network of over **6,000 scouts worldwide**.  

### **Objective**  
The primary goal of this analysis is to **explore and interpret player attributes** to assist in the scouting and recruitment process. The dataset includes a variable dictionary and contains key information such as player ratings, positions, physical attributes, and market values.  

The analysis answers several key scouting-related questions:  
1. **Player Characteristics:** Exploring age, height, position, country, and overall ratings.  
2. **Performance and Attributes:** Understanding distributions of **height, skill moves, weak foot, and overall rating**.  
3. **Performance Trends:** Investigating if **goalkeepers' height impacts their ratings** and if **left-footed players perform better than right-footed ones**.  
4. **Top 5 Leagues Impact:** Assessing whether the **best players are concentrated in top European leagues** (England, Spain, Germany, Italy, France).  
5. **Positional Insights:** Comparing the proportion of **left-footed midfielders (CM vs. CAM)**.  

### **Technologies & Tools Used**  
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib)  
- **Data Visualization:** Histograms, boxplots, bar charts, pie charts  
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Mean, median, mode, standard deviation  

This project provides **insights into player recruitment strategies**, helping clubs identify **key trends and attributes** that contribute to performance.
